📊 Sales Performance Dashboard — Power BI Project

🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and developing an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI to help business stakeholders analyze product performance, sales trends, and territory-based revenue distribution.

Compare Sales by Product Category

Analyze Sales Trends Month-over-Month

Identify Top Performing Sales Representatives

Visualize Sales Contribution by Territory through dynamic pie charts and filters

Filter reports by year and product category for detailed drill-down insights

The dashboard is optimized for user interactivity using slicers, tooltips, and responsive layout design.
